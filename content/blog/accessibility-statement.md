## Conformance status

The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) defines requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA. GBG's digital products are partially conformant with WCAG 2.1 level AA, which means that some parts of the content do not fully conform to the accessibility standard.
