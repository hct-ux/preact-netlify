## What Foundation offers

There are many benefits in using Foundation and contributing to its code base, including: 

* **Cost saving** - Less time and effort required to create solutions to customer problems
* **Consistency** - Components are on-brand and can be mixed and matched
* **Less technical debt** - Tried and tested code that reduces QA testing time per delivery
* **Performance** - Components are optimised for site speed, usability and performance
* **Accessibility** - We're currently auditing all components to deliver WCAG AA as standard
* **Support** - Regular updates provide additions, bug fixes and improvements

## For developers

Foundation comes in Vanilla and React flavours. Introductory guides, helpers, templates and a set of interactive components are on the [GBG Component Library site](https://ds.gbgplc.com/).

We're moving from bespoke icons to using the Feather Icons library, which is included as a dependency. See the [official documentation](https://github.com/feathericons/feather).

## For designers

To enable GBG fonts and brand colours, enable the [Core Figma library](https://www.figma.com/file/gI0cR79DXpIR7BnoOcwhTA/Core) in your designs. The [Foundation Web Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/AaNhoCE79Ujq8j9gkgOSuu/Foundation-Web?node-id=5272%3A8276) includes the components you can copy into your own designs and to understand how components can be used, see [components index](/components).

The bespoke icons in our Core Figma have been superseded by Feather Icons. Make sure you stick to using one set within a product, using [Feather Icons](https://www.figma.com/file/JOboXGyiWSmdTKaHNJqNG3/Feather-Icons?node-id=0%3A1) for any new projects.

## Extending Foundation

Our component library aims to suit common needs, but product teams will always have specific requirements. When that happens, tell us what you need, and we’ll do our best to help. We might be able to build or change a component, saving time and effort for your team.

By contributing to Foundation, we all benefit from a bigger and better set of components, making it easier and faster to build high-quality digital journeys.
