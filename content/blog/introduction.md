## Extending Foundation

Our component library aims to suit common needs, but product teams will always have specific requirements. When that happens, tell us what you need, and we’ll do our best to help. We might be able to build or change a component, saving time and effort for your team.

By contributing to Foundation, we all benefit from a bigger and better set of components, making it easier and faster to build high-quality digital journeys.
