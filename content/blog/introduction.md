## What Foundation offers

There are many benefits in using Foundation and contributing to its code base, including: 

* **Cost saving**\
  Less time and effort required to create solutions to customer problems
* **Consistency**\
  Components are on-brand and can be mixed-and-matched
* **Accessibility**\
  We're currently auditing all components to deliver WCAG AA as standard
* **Less technical debt**\
  Tried-and-tested code that reduces QA testing time per delivery
* **Performance**\
  Components are optimised for site speed, usability and performance
* **Support**\
  Regular updates provide additions, bug fixes and improvements

## For developers

Foundation comes in Vanilla and React flavours. Developers can find getting started guides along with helpers, templates and a set of interactive components on the [GBG Component Library](https://ds.gbgplc.com/).

We're moving from bespoke icons to using the Feather Icons library, which is included as a dependency. See the [official documentation](https://github.com/feathericons/feather).

## For designers

Product designers should start by enabling the [Core Figma library](https://www.figma.com/file/gI0cR79DXpIR7BnoOcwhTA/Core) to access GBG fonts and brand colours. The [Foundation Web Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/AaNhoCE79Ujq8j9gkgOSuu/Foundation-Web?node-id=5272%3A8276) includes all available components you can copy into your own designs; to understand how components can be used, see [Components](/components).

We previously used bespoke icons (in our Core file). These have been superseded by Feather Icons. Make sure you stick to using one set within a product, using [Feather Icons](https://www.figma.com/file/JOboXGyiWSmdTKaHNJqNG3/Feather-Icons?node-id=0%3A1) for any new projects.

## Extending Foundation

Our component library aims to suit common needs, but product teams will always have specific requirements. When that happens, tell us what you need, and we’ll collaborate to solve your problem. We might be able to build a component for you, saving time and effort for your team.

By contributing to Foundation, we all benefit from a bigger and better set of components that make it easier and faster to build high-quality digital journeys.
