## Getting started guides

We have separate guides for our [React](https://darling-kataifi-e3972e.netlify.app/getting-started-react/) and [Vanilla](https://darling-kataifi-e3972e.netlify.app/getting-started-vanilla/) flavours.

## Release notes

For [React](https://ds.gbgplc.com/release-notes/react/) and [Vanilla](https://ds.gbgplc.com/release-notes/vanilla/) [](https://darling-kataifi-e3972e.netlify.app/release-notes-react/)flavours (external links).

## Component library helper

We love Visual Studio Code, so much so that we've created an extension to make the component library as easy to use in it as possible.

Search 'GBG' from within Visual Studio, or download it fromÂ the marketplace.
