To enable GBG fonts and brand colours, enable the [Core Figma library](https://www.figma.com/file/gI0cR79DXpIR7BnoOcwhTA/Core) in your designs. The [Foundation Web Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/AaNhoCE79Ujq8j9gkgOSuu/Foundation-Web?node-id=5272%3A8276) includes the components you can copy into your own designs and to understand how components can be used, refer to the [Components](/components).

The bespoke icons in our Core Figma have been superseded by Feather Icons. Make sure you stick to using one set within a product, using [Feather Icons](https://www.figma.com/file/JOboXGyiWSmdTKaHNJqNG3/Feather-Icons?node-id=0%3A1) for any new projects.
