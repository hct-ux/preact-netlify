description: Switch toggles allow a simple, binary "on / off” selection.
preview: https://ds.gbgplc.com/react/iframe.html?id=atoms-controls--switch-elements
dos:
  - Use a switch to turn an option on or off
  - Text labels must allow a clear “on / off” answer with no ambiguity
  - Be mindful of the power of default selections and only use a switch when
    it’s reasonable to set a default answer
donts:
  - Don't use where either answer could lead to an error
  - Don’t use when a conscious selection is required since the default state
    presumes an answer
  - Don't use when a radio, checkbox or a toggle button group could make the
    interaction simpler
examples:
