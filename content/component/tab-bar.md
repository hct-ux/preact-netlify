  a single context.

dos:
  - Order tabs left to right, by priority
  - Consider how you denote the bottom of tab content, to avoid confusion with
    content that might directly follow on from the tab group. For example, add a
    keyline or a clear heading
  - Use clear and short text labels, no more than two or three words
donts:
  - Avoid lots of items within a single tab group (ideally no more than six)
  - Nesting tabs can cause confusion and is best avoided
  - Do not use tabs when a user needs to see all the information contained
    within them at the same time (such as when making comparisons)
examples:
  - title: Full width
    description: A tab set encapsulates everything that is underneath it without
      enclosing it visually.
