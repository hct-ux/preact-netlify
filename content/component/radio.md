  list, with the following options: 


  * State (default, error, disabled) 

  * Horizontal

dos:
  - Radios are best for 2-8 options and often preferable over selects due to all
    options being visible. This makes the interaction easier (especially on
    small screens)
  - The radio and its label are clickable to provide a larger target area
  - Only use the horizontal option when the text labels are very short
donts:
  - Don’t use for a single option
