dos:
  - Ensure segment colours have sufficient contrast and are tested with a colour
    blindness tool
  - Always include a key or legend, and label segments in a way that’s
    accessible to assistive technologies
  - Try to include an alternative view of any visualised data, this gives the
    user control over how they consume the information
donts:
  - Don’t rely solely on mouseover or focus states to communicate information
examples:
  - title: Generic chart
    description: There are many different chart types, such as bar, line, donut and
      histogram.
