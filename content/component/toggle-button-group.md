title: Toggle button group
date: 2022-06-27T12:25:38.693Z
description: Allows users to select from a short list of options. This can be
  easier to use than a dropdown because all options are always visible and
  selectable.

dos:
  - Keep text labels clear and short, preferably no more than two words
  - Use icons only when they clearly enhance the understanding of option choices
  - For lists of more than five options, use radios or a select dropdown
donts:
  - Don't mix item types (include icons on all items, or none)
  - Donâ€™t use when the user can select more than one item. Use checkboxes instead
examples:
  - title: Default

    description: Items can contain a text label, an icon, or both together.
  - description: Small groups can be used when the default size is not appropriate.
