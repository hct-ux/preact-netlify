dos:
  - Update the success and error states only after an input has been completed
    (not during entry)
  - Allow vertical resizing
donts:
  - If the input is likely to be less than 50 characters, use a text field
    instead.
  - Avoid using a placeholder for information thatâ€™s critical to completing the
    field
  - Don't allow horizontal resizing unless it's a specific requirement
