  Pills are used to present a text label, status or tag.

dos:
  - Removing a pill must have a clear effect on the current view, for instance
    changing an associated list of items. When a further action is required to
    enact the change (such as submitting a form) the pill must be clearly part
    of a form group
  - Removable pills must be focusable with the keyboard
  - Ensure that the wording of the pill clearly conveys any status (such as a
    positive or negative connotation) without relying on colour alone
donts:
  - Don’t apply custom colours to pills
  - Don’t include anything other than short text inside pills (e.g. icons or
    sentences)
examples:
  - title: Default
    description: Non-removable pills are generally used to denote status, or to tag content.
