dos:
  - Use for inputs whose values usually appear alongside a symbol (such as
    currency) or instances where context or differentiation is useful (such as
    location)
  - Use in conjunction with a text label. Neither icon nor text enhancements are
    intended to replace a field label
  - Ensure front-end validation matches the intended input, for instance don't
    allow letters to be typed into a currency symbol input
